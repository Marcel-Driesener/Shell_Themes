# Automatic Download Script for [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/)

> **Note:** This script is for my personal use, as I accidentally deleted my Windows partition like 2 times while trying to install Linux and had to setup the Shell again and again. Feel free to use or modify it.

## Steps to Use the Script

1. **Clone the Repository** or download the `.ps1` file.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TryingToLearnNewThings/Shell-Themes.git
   ```
   Or manually download the script file.

2. **Execute the Script as Administrator**
   ```powershell
   .\your-script.ps1
   ```

3. **Let It Run**
   The script will handle the installation automatically.
